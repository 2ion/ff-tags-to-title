### ff-tags-to-title

Simple Firefox addon that, if the current page has been bookmarked and
tagged, adds the tags to the displayed tab title.


#### Installation on Arch Linux

You may install the package from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-tags2title).

#### Build on Firefox \< 38

Install the Firefox SDK, source its bin/activate script in Bash, change
into this addon's directory and run:
```
cfx xpi
```
Install the resulting XPI file as usual in Firefox.

#### Build on Firefox \>= 38

From Firefox 38 onwards, jpm is used instead of cfx/the old addon SDK
for building the extension. The jpm port of this addon lives on a
different branch:
```
git checkout jpm-port
jpm xpi
```
